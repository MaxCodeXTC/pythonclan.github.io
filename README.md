[pythonclan.github.io](pythonclan.github.io)

To begin we will need Ruby and Jekyll installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/PythonClan/pythonclan.github.io.git
```

```cd``` to pythonclan.github.io then

```shell
gem install bundler
bunlde install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will install the dependencies and run the website locally.

You can also create/edit files from GitHub directly as well.

I can make some articles on how to make new posts, pages, etc. If nothing else, just make a new file and I can format it for us.
