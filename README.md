[pythonclan.github.io](pythonclan.github.io)

To begin we will need ruby and jekyll installed. 

```
git clone https://github.com/PythonClan/pythonclan.github.io.git
```

```cd``` to pythonclan.github.io then 

```
gem install bundler
bunlde install 
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will install the dependencies and run the website locally. 

You can also create/edit files from Github directly as well. 

I can make some articles on how to make new posts, pages, etc. If nothing else, just make a new file and I can format it for us.
