Welcome to the website made with [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I hope this is an easy way for us to make pages and posts related to our group as well.

There are ways to use Markdown to post code:

```python
print(f"Hello, World!")
```

Let's make pages and posts and encourage those that want to share their own content to make pull requests for posts and we'll update them and can approve what gets put on the website.
