While being a moderator for the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/python/) we see a lot of the same questions on repeat.

- What to learn next?
- What are some suggestions for projects?
- what else should I do?

And the list goes on. What I'd like to do is start a mini series where we will start taking these questions and writing about them. That way other beginners or individuals who need ideas have a place to start.

To begin reviewing and writing code has been something I have always loved doing. Now getting an opportunity to take your questions and write about them is going to be fun.

I have a list of sample projects we'd like to dive into and explain as much as we can about what is happening. When I started I saw great code, and could always read more than I could write. From doing this I've also been able to then see what I needed to do and start remembering things. The problem I had was no one explained what was happening. I had the solution but didn't know what it was doing.

Self promo plug - I've started this at another site, and might bring in examples from previous posts too.

The goal as well is to get other Moderators and members to share their thoughts and write as well.

[Let us know](https://forms.gle/2YCFaj8DyDHt7a7Y7) what you think we should do next!
